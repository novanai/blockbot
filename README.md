# Blockbot

Blockbot is a Discord bot, written in Python, that is maintained by the Redbrick Webgroup. This project uses [`hikari`](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari/), an opinionated microframework, to interface with the Discord API. [`hikari-arc`](https://github.com/hypergonial/hikari-arc) is the command handler of choice.
